      title: Implementing enemies
      content:
            I worked inside the engine using <b>Unity's animator</b> and <b>used a custom finite state machine
                tool</b>
            to implement enemies into the game.
            <br />I worked hand-in-hand with the AI programmer to be able to do faster
            refinements on the enemies.
    balancing-enemies:
      title: Balancing enemies
      content: To balance the game, I used <b>internal feedback</b> from the team combined with <b>mathematical
                balancing</b>
            based on the target player behaviours we wanted to have.
    caption-list: All animations phases have easy to tweak timings.;
                  A finite state machine (FSM) I made to implement the spike catcher's behavior;
                  Upstream balancing of monsters by using mathematical tests
  design-presentations:
    title: Design Presentations
    content: To ensure everyone is up to date with the latest design decisions, we arrange presentations
        that <b>explain design intentions</b>, <b>why solutions were accepted or rejected</b> and
        what we decided.
    caption-list: Presenting mechanics to the team,
                  Reference technical documentation to explain how it works and give it more exposure,
                  Seeing the system through the user eyes to highlight what's important,
                  Explaining what are the standard solutions for this problem,
                  Explaining design intentions to give an idea of why solutions were rejected/accepted,
                  Giving an overview of the inner workings of the system,
                  A link to technical documentation is available in every slide,
                  Giving intentions also help User Researchers to know what to test,
                  Reusing the same diagrams as in technical documentation to foster readability
  enemy-design:
    title: Designing Enemies
    3Cs:
      title: From the 3Cs to Enemies
      content: We built our enemies <b>in regards to the character's moveset we made.</b>
            Each enemy challenges specific skills and all skills are
            covered by our enemy set.
    constraints:
      title: Designing with production constraints
      content: <b>We suggested simple & functional character designs</b> to the art team
            as a basis to iterate upon and to be able to meet deadlines.
            <b>For example</b>, the spike catcher design matches its behaviour
            without the need to add hard-to-animate hands.
    caption-list: "<b>Termite</b>: a basic monster challenging dodging and throwing spikes;
                  <b>Spike Catcher</b>: A monster with a counter attack that forces to move;
                  <b>Mosquitoe</b>: Explosive kamikaze mob to keep you on your toes;
                  <b>Firefly</b> An explosive firefly to add variations and danger to combat situations"
  fast-prototyping:
    title: Fast prototyping
    3Cs:
      title: Prototyping 3Cs
      content: To be able to get a better grasp on our 3Cs as soon as possible,
            <b>I prototyped some parts of our character controller and added gamefeel elements</b> such as
            animations.
    toys:
      title: Toys
      content: To <b>test our 3Cs and gamefeel early on</b>, we prototyped toys such as breakable objects that are
            shown in the adjacent gif.
  feature-asset-lists:
    title: Feature & asset lists
    description: Throughout the project, we built several asset and feature lists as <b>a way to facilitate
                the work with others</b>. Building asset lists with other team members allows
                everyone to be on the same basis and designers to give them information about what is
                the most important for the game.
    caption-list: AI Action and Decision Asset List to work with the AI programmer.;
                  Listing and designing Signs & feedback with our UX designer.;
                  Animation asset list as a work document used with our external animator.
  technical-documents:
    title: Technical Documents
    description: <b>Writing synthetic and comprehensive technical documents</b> to ensure
        the team uses the same vocabulary and has a document to refer to.
        Here is the technical document we wrote on the <b>throw & aim mechanic</b>.
    caption-list: Using Google Slides allows for easier teamwork,
                  Overview of the feature before going in-depth into details,
                  Illustrating clearly each situation with a diagram creates documents that are easier to read,
                  Coherent symbols in every diagram make for a more readable document,
                  I am able to design mathematical models that are adapted to our intentions,
                  Detailing meaningful tweakable parameters to facilitate work with programmers,
                  Detailing our design intentions ensure each member can take the right decisions

    title: Writing Documents
    description: <b>Writing synthetic and comprehensive documents</b> which can be modified
        and shared easily is decisive. Here is an excerpt from a document
        I have made for this project.
    caption-list: Writing synthetic and comprehensive specs with clear schemes;
                  Using Google Slides allows for easier teamwork;
                  The whole document is made with one software to foster fast iterations;
                  Coherent symbols in every schemes make for a more readable document
  research:
    decisions-title: Making well informed decisions.
    decisions-content: I investigated <b>several subjects</b> during this project to be able
            to make <b>well informed decisions</b>. To be more efficient, we split
            the workload to research key design fields during the beginning
            of the project.
    level-design-title: Research in Level Design
    level-design-content: Iterating over level design and testing out ideas was also part of
            my work in this project.

                  Exploring the relevance of verticality for our levels,
                  Iterations and exploration for the game last level
  one-page:
    title: One Page
    reminder:
      title: A reminder
      content: The role of this one page is to have all <b>core mechanics</b> of the game
            <b>synthetized in one poster</b> which is always <b>visible by the team</b>.
    cuts:
      title: Feature Cuts
      content: Some of the presented features were cut. We kept mechanics
            that were the <b>most important</b> in building our goal experience.
  metrics:
    title: metrics
    caption-list: Camera projection on ground to build well sized levels;
                  Camera minimal zoom to ensure objects that are big enough on screen;
                  Objects size (non-interactable in blue, interactable in yellow)
    camera:
      title: Camera
      content: We defined camera's maximum range, object and character sizes to <b>ensure game readability</b>.
            This led to our level size as we wanted <b>one-screen levels</b>.
    level-metrics:
      title: Level Metrics
      content: Walls' height and thickness were then defined on the camera view to <b>minimize
            blind spots</b> while still <b>ensuring circulation clarity</b>.
        <br>We used a base unit (1m) to build our levels.
    helpers:
      title: Helpers
      content: I made helpers to <b>ensure metrics were respected</b> when we integrated content
            and designed levels.

    external-playtests:
      title: Using external playtests
      content: Our UX/UR designer made several playtests to gather feedbacks,
            but we had not enough iterations to balance the game with only these playtests.
    short-time:
      title: Balancing a game in a small amount of time
      content: We dedicated team playtests to balancing. During these sessions I balanced the game on the fly,
            taking into account our dev team's skills, which allowed an overall balanced experienced
            despite our small time resources.
    caption-list: Custom unity layout to have all interesting values to balance during balancing playtests;

      title: Including the team
      content: We <b>gathered ideas</b> during <b>brainstorming</b> sessions
            that we would then <b>filter and refine</b> to get to
            mechanics matching our intentions and scope.
    informing:
      title: Keeping the team informed
      content: We also held small and short meetings to <b>keep the team updated</b> with
            <b>key decisions</b> in the beginning of the project.
    programmers:
      title: Working with programmers
      content: My <b>engineering skills</b> allowed me to easily <b>understand
                programming challenges</b> and to design features with the <b>right
                level of detail</b>.
